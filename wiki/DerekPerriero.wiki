#summary Derek Perriero, who me?

=Sobre Mi=

I'm a long time user of Linux and the GNU movement.  I'm always willing to learn more!
I'm the secretary of morLUG, here on campus and I work downtown in the WVU Libraries Systems office.

I love learning new programming languages and like to embrace new projects with those languages.  Currently I'm a big advocate of working in the web development community and enhancing that with AJAX driven technologies.

I love sports, especially soccer, which I play on a team (FCTROG) in the summer.
