"Everything in relative, even the relativity."

"The reason behind every failure in our lives is to prepare us for something bigger; the opposing wind is there to take us higher."

"Behind every successful man, there is a WOMAN and behind every unsuccessful man, there is a GIRL."

"We can never gain anything in this life, never. We give away pain for happiness, tears for a smile, those we love for that we adore, love for lust, trust for the thing we thought we must and finally life for death."
