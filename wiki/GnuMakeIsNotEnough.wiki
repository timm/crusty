#summary GNU make is not enough

(sung to the tunes of Garbage's "The World Is Not Enough")

GNU Make is not enough  

I know how to ant  
I know how to scons  
I know what to cook  
And what to jam  
I know when to imake  
And I know when to myke  
No one ever died from building too much  

GNU Make is not enough  
But it is such a perfect place to start, my love  
And if you’re strong enough  
Together we can make the world again, my love  

People like us  
Know how to build code  
There’s no point in coding  
If you can’t build the app  
We know when to fork()  
And we know when to kill()  
If we can’t build it all  
Then nobody will  

GNU Make is not enough  
But it is such a perfect place to start, my love  
And if you’re strong enough  
Together we can make the world again, my love  

I…i feel sick  
I…i feel scared  
I…i feel ready  
And yet unprepared  

GNU Make is not enough  
But it is such a perfect place to start, my love  
And if you’re strong enough  
Together we can make the world again, my love  

GNU Make is not enough
