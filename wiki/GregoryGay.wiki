Greg is a Junior in the Computer Science program at WVU. He is also 
minoring in English. He is a pirate and detests ninjas. This is a 
problem, as ninjas are common in West Virginia.

He spends what little free time that he has writing for geek culture site 4 Color Rebellion 
(http://www.4colorrebellion.com). He is also the vice-president of the 
local chapter of ACM. 

He plans to take over the world.
