I recently bought my wife a Nintendo Wii. It was intended as a Christmas present but they were impossible to get during the holiday season, so I picked one up a couple of weeks ago. The system is a lot of fun and the controller design is inspiring. So inspiring in fact, that I thought it would be fun to have a look at what it would take to develop some web apps for the system. The developer kit for the Wii will be sold at a little over $1700.00. Now I know what you're thinking, "Wow! What a bargain!" But wait there's more! From a post on nwiizone.com:

"This is a message i got from Nintendo when inquiring about their dev kit.
Hello and thank you for contacting Nintendo, From time to time we hear from our fans with programming experience who wish to acquire development kits for purposes of game development. While we applaud your desire to develop software for our systems, Nintendoâ€™s development kits are only made available to established game developers. This means that you must have a stable business organization (adequate office facilities, equipment, personnel and financial resources) in order to ensure a secure and effective environment for working with its publisher, be it Nintendo or a third-party licensee. Also, you must have demonstrated the ability to develop and program excellent software for Nintendo video game systems or for other video game or computer systems. Sincerely, Nintendo of America Inc.Dervin Camden"

If this isn't just the perfect model of cathedral-style development. Proprietary, closed-source, and you can't even buy in if you want to because you are just not worthy. This actually comes as a bit of a culture shock to me. I suppose I've been lucky growing up during a time when much of the innovation in software development has come from the open source world. The open source world is one where anyone with a good idea has something to contribute. Nintendo's world seems to be one where only those with a good idea for profit have something to contribute. How sad.
