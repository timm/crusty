1) Your $HOME/.bashrc needs this line:

	. opt/crusty/crusty/etc/dotbashrc

2) Your $HOME/.bash_profile needs this line:

	. opt/crusty/crusty/etc/login/dotbash_profile

3) Depending on what editor you use, then...
3a) If you use nano, Your $HOME/.nanorc file needs some lines.
3a) If you use vim, Your $HOME/.vimrc file needs this line:
	 
	 source $HOME/opt/crusty/crusty/etc/dotvimrc

3b) If you use emacs, Your $HOME/.emacs file needs this line:

---| install |--------------------------------------

Once configured, you should run these two lines:

	. ~/.bash_profile
	. ~/.bashrc

or, if this is not your first install, just run

	crust

(Note: these scripts  are run automatically at login.
So the next time you log on, you won't have to do anything
special to access these tools.)
